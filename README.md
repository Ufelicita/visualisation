The box plot gives a visual indication of the distribution of a data based on its five-number summary of data points: the minimum, first quartile [Q1], median, third quartile [Q3], and maximum. It is best suited for visualizing the dispersion of a dataset. It is observed from the graph that the whites earn more on the average as shown in the higher median of the White ethnicity Box. However, the outlier shown indicates that some individuals who are white earn significantly higher than their other white contemporaries. Also, compared to the rest of the ethnicities, the blacks have less variability in earnings, while the Asians have the most.
